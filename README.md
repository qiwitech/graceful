# graceful
Graceful is an RPC framework and protobuf service generator. It's quiet similar to gRPC but a little bit lighter.

Graceful is intended to be used for communication between [QDP API](https://github.com/qiwitech/qdp) and its clients. Code for QDP API already generated and committed in [QDP](https://github.com/qiwitech/qdp) repo, so you only need this one to have compilation succeed.

If you are looking for some general purpose RPC framework you'd better to use [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc)
